      <h1 class="title">Innovative Teaching using Technology</h1>
      <p>E-learning can contribute to teaching, learning and research activities. The effective and efficient use thereof in an online environment is often dependent on the fulfillment of other strategies, such as the integration of web-based components into curricula and equipping learner and staff with up-to-date, relevant knowledge and skills.
        The integration of e-learning in teaching and learning can enhance quality education by contributing towards the provision of student-centred learning experiences that are flexible, responsive and meet the needs of all learners. Embedding an online component into the curriculum means that a learner cannot reasonably be expected to meet the learning outcomes of the course without accessing or engaging with the electronically delivered or -supported components of the course. Therefore, the success of online learning and teaching depends on the effective inter-operation of all systems supporting the learner, and will enable a flexible and independent learning experience.

            <p class="justify">This is a six-topic course that introduces a range of technologies and applications that could be used in your teaching. 
              Each topic is independently discussed where knowledge of a previous topic’s content is not required. 
              Most topics can be completed in a week although some might take two. 
              Participants have at most 7 weeks to cover all the topics but since all topics are available upfront it is up to each individual to decide how much time they spend on each topic.</p>
